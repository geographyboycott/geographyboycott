## Meet Geographers for Justice in Palestine

- **Date**: 3/24/2025
- **Time**: 2:30 PM - 3:50 PM 

> Over the past year, and following a call from Palestinian trade unions—including from the education sector—many have mobilised against the genocide, urbicide, and scholasticide in Gaza and Lebanon. Actions have included divestment campaigns, boycott pledges, and building and supporting student encampments. These efforts build on successes of the South African anti-apartheid movement, which adopted divestment as a vital practice to build global pressure and end a system of institutionalized racial injustice. Despite widespread efforts, many universities and research institutions remain complicit in Israel’s crimes—through partnerships and investments that support arms companies fueling these attacks. Within this landscape, what is our geographical responsibility? How can we respond to a situation of complete annihilation? How can geography, a discipline committed to social justice and decolonial theory, intervene? How do we live up to the legacy of geography as a critical and radical discipline? And how can we ensure our institutions support critical conversations and engage in meaningful action?
