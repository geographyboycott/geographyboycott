### Who we are

We, as geographers and other AAG members, stand in solidarity with the movement for Palestinian self-determination, liberation, and return. We understand this movement to be aligned with struggles for justice, equality, and decolonization around the world, and thus core to our academic mission.

**We pledge** to affirm and support the Palestinian call for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) as essential to the struggle for Palestinian self-determination, liberation, and return. We call on the AAG and its members to: 
Boycott and suspend partnerships with Israeli academic institutions until these institutions end their complicity in the illegal occupation, Israeli apartheid regime, and violation of Palestinian rights as stipulated in international law
Divest from companies and Israeli state entities profiting from the dispossession and death of Palestinian land and people, by disclosing all current investments, making a concrete plan for divestment, and refraining from making future investments in companies and Israeli state entities profiting from the illegal occupation, Israeli apartheid regime, and violation of Palestinian rights as stipulated in international law
Hold a special meeting to consider resolutions on academic boycott and divestment that will concretize and enact support for the Palestinian call for BDS.

**I pledge** to attend that special meeting, and I pledge to vote in favor of the resolutions for boycott and divestment.
