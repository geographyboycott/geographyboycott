<!-- ### Who we are

We are a network of geographers and AAG members in solidarity with the movement for Palestinian self-determination in all its forms. We understand this movement to be aligned with struggles for justice, equality, and decolonization around the world.

We pledge to affirm and support the Palestinian call for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) as essential to the struggle for Palestinian self-determination. 

Boycott and suspend partnerships with Israeli academic institutions until these institutions end their complicity in the illegal occupation, Israeli apartheid regime, and violation of Palestinian rights as stipulated in international law
Divest from companies and state entities profiting from the dispossession and death of Palestinian land and people, by disclosing all current investments, making a concrete plan for divestment, and refraining from making future investments in companies and state entities profiting from the illegal occupation, Israeli apartheid regime, and violation of Palestinian rights as stipulated in international law -->
