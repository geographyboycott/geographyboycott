{{< intro >}}

Below we have compiled some of the most relevant scholarly literature about Palestine, Israel, and BDS. These interventions come from geographers and leading scholars of the Middle East. This is not an exhaustive list, but all the articles here contribute significantly to understanding the longstanding and ongoing genocidal campaign by Israel and its allies against the Palestinian people. They also aid us in grappling with different organizing strategies aimed at stopping this horrific violence and winning Palestinian liberation.
