## Words of support from geographical organizations

{{< intro >}}

Many specialty groups and other geographical collectives have leant their words of support to this campaign. Below you can find some of their singular reasons for doing so, which together demonstrate the powerful and cross-cutting relevance of Palestinian liberation to the field of geography.

{{< accordion title="The Antipode Editorial Collective" >}}

The Antipode Editorial Collective is proud to endorse the Geographers for Justice in Palestine campaign for an academic boycott, by the American Association of Geographers (AAG), of Israeli academic institutions, and for disclosure and divestment of any AAG funds that go towards supporting the ongoing apartheid government of Israel. As a journal of radical geography, Antipode is fully committed to praxis. We can think of no better application of the theories our discipline has been producing in recent decades than to apply the extensive knowledge we have developed on settler colonialism, Orientalism, the geopolitics of the War on Terror, and genocide to actively intervene in the ongoing death and destruction of the Palestinian people and their homeland by supporting the call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) by Palestinian civil society.  
<br><br>
In his inaugural 1969 editorial for Antipode, David Stea argued: "A society which measures man's (sic) worth in terms of volume of publications accumulated is no less sick than one which measures his worth in terms of dollars amassed." Fifty-six years later, we could not agree more. What is our knowledge for if not to transform the actually existing world, here and now? We convey much gratitude and solidarity to the Palestinian movement for self-determination, and allied groups such as the Geographers for Justice in Palestine, for awakening us, once more, from our dogmatic academic slumber. The time for concrete interventions is now. We stand firmly behind GJP and all geographers advancing the BDS movement.

{{< accordion title="Black Geographies Specialty Group" >}}

The Black Geographies Specialty Group condemns the Israeli war on Palestinian peoples, settler colonial violence of Israeli apartheid, Israel’s perpetuation of the genocide of Palestinians, and the United States’ uninterrupted financial and political support for Israel. We continue to mourn the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian people murdered within the past fifteen months and the Palestinian livelihoods devastated by unscrupulous imperialist and settler colonial tactics since 1917. We also celebrate, learn from, and stand in solidarity with Palestinian thinkers, artists, scholars, land stewards, guides, healers, leaders, and resistors in Palestine and throughout the diaspora. At this pivotal moment, we urge geographers to amplify rather than relax their commitments to the Palestinian liberation movement. 
<br><br>
Palestinian liberation encompasses an expansive history of struggle and resistance. For over 73 years, the Palestinian people have resisted zionist violence and terror. Most recently, since October 2023, armed and abetted by the United States, Israeli forces have targeted the Palestinian people through war, genocide, settler colonialism, and continued apartheid.  In the wake of these horrors, It is imperative to understand that Zionism is, fundamentally, a settler ideology that is entangled with white supremacy, colonization, and racial capitalism both within and beyond the territory of Occupied Palestine. It must be recognized as such and condemned in our liberation efforts. 
<br><br>
While the violence in Palestine touches all of us in different ways based on our identities and experiences, we are all complicit in the Israeli colonial project through the entangled histories of our discipline and by virtue of being taxpayers in the United States. We refuse to remain silent as our nation-state, discipline, and workplaces sustain zionist violence and terror against our Palestinian colleagues and comrades. 
<br><br>
In solidarity with the resistance of Palestinians and the response of mass protest around the world, Geographers have an intellectual duty to oppose the Palestinian genocide in our capacity as scholars, educators, and researchers, regardless of sub-field. From basing cartographic practices on the concept of terra nullius to embedding white supremacist classifications into the machine learning systems that power GIS technologies, settler colonial logics have found too comfortable a home in our discipline. Geographers must consistently and unflinchingly challenge these uses in their work and practice alternative methods imbued with justice. While this work is exceedingly condemned by anti-intellectual and anti-democratic movements and proponents of Palestinian liberation continue to be the targets of political repression, concession is not and can never be an option. This moment holds the potential for transformative social change. 
<br><br>
Black academic and activist lineage on this matter goes back at least to to Malcolm X’s of “Zionist Logic” in 1964, to the Israeli occupation of Palestine in 1967 and the Black Power activists who stood by the Palestine Liberation Organization, and to the Third World non-aligned movements that fostered anticolonial and anticapitalist development throughout the Cold War. More recently in 2014, when Palestinians in Gaza were being killed by the thousands, and when Black people like Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri were being killed indiscriminately by U.S. police, Black and Palestinian activists found very little difference between these violent demonstrations of U.S. racial imperialism. As Black Geographers critical of colonial, racial capitalist, and state violence, our pursuits for Black liberation are necessarily bound to the liberation of racialized, dehumanized, and brutalized peoples of the world. Our studies of Blackness transgress nation-state boundaries, categories of the Human, and insist on forging pathways of solidarity as worldmaking.
<br><br>
Our universities have also historically been sites for organizing to divest capital from apartheid regimes. In 1988, following the lead of labor organizers decades earlier, 155 U.S. colleges had divested at least part of their portfolios from South African companies. Today dozens of FSJP organizers are drawing on this legacy of Black radical solidarity to advocate for boycott and divestment from the financial machines of Israeli state power. We ask that our colleagues support in whatever ways that they can and urge our colleagues to mobilize for profound transformations of our discipline and our institutions of higher learning. 
<br><br>
Within and beyond the academy, we must all acknowledge, honor, and continue the work of liberation struggles for all and to collectively build worlds of radical transformation and racial justice.

The Black Geographies Specialty Group Executive Committee

{{< accordion title="Disability Specialty Group" >}}

The Disability Specialty Group has endorsed the BDS pledge to boycott Israeli academic institutions. This commitment builds on our endorsement of the Geographers for Justice in Palestine AAG 2025 pre-conference. 
<br><br>
We bear witness to the bodily, emotional, and mental harm caused to Palestinians by Israel's illegal occupation. As geographers who write about, with, and through disability and debility, we cannot ignore the mass disabling events that the State of Israel and its allies have wrought upon Palestine (see Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha 2024 <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2024/01/26/palestine-is-disabled/">here</a>). While we know the presence of disability is not antithetical to justice, its violent mass production in the name of settler colonialism must be stopped. With a tenuous ceasefire in place, Israel's apartheid regime still controls the Gaza strip and daily encroaches on ever more land and life in the West Bank. 
<br><br>
As critical disability scholars and disability justice activists have asserted, we must think internationally and multi-scalarly about disability and debility. There is no disability justice without justice for Palestine. Indeed, we must "consider how ableism acts on national bodies-occupied, colonized, Indigenous national bodies-as opposed to thinking about the body as a purely atomized individual entity" (Sheehi and Jaffee 2024, see <a href="https://rdsjournal.org/index.php/journal/article/view/1321/2790">here</a>). We stand in solidarity with Palestinians as an act of resistance against ableism and coloniality. 
<br><br>
We recognize that students and faculty around the world are facing professional and material repercussions for organizing for Palestinian liberation. As scholars, we strive to protect our students' right to such principled protests without persecution. Through this boycott pledge, we stand in solidarity with all those who continue to protest and boycott globally against apartheid and genocide.

{{< accordion title="Energy & Environment Specialty Group" >}}

The Energy & Environment Specialty Group (EESG) stands in solidarity for Palestinian self-determination, liberation and return. We encourage our specialty group members and other members of the AAG to support this petition to call a special meeting of the AAG about this issue. As energy geographers, we do applied scholarship. We are uniquely positioned to interrogate the intersections and entanglements of complex relations of energetic and political power. But alongside our analytical and pedagogical engagements, we must also work towards dismantling systems of oppression in support of emancipatory and transformational solutions to socio-ecological problems. The ongoing genocide against Palestinians and occupation of Palestine compels us to organize for liberation within our institutions and spheres of influence. A reckoning is long overdue. We must address the enduring epistemic injustices our discipline (geography) and subdiscipline (energy geographies) have enacted, sustained and exacerbated. We must address our complicity in genocidal and ecocidal atrocities globally. This is particularly true in Palestine. In closing, we implore you to join the GJP campaign to call a special AAG meeting. We invite you to participate in such abolitionist engagements within our discipline and group. Thank you for your consideration and advocacy for this cause. Free Palestine.

{{< accordion title="Latin America Specialty Group" >}}

The Latin America Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers (AAG) offers its support of the Geographers for Justice in Palestine and their efforts within the AAG. Approximately 90% of those who voted in our anonymous poll indicated their support of Geographers for Justice in Palestine.
<br><br>
We are geographers, faculty, graduate students, and people of conscience organizing in response to the Israeli state’s oppressive policies towards Palestinians. We have long identified these principles as central to our praxis as Latinamericanist geographers. In our 2010 Statement of Ethics we stated, “[w]e also hold allegiances to scholarly disciplines, the broader society and culture, the human species, other species, and the integrity of places and things.” These ethics guide our research, politics, and professional endeavors, and we stand firm in our support of struggles for liberation and in our support of Palestinians.
<br><br>
We know the effects of violence, dispossession, and fear as tools deployed against marginalized, oppressed, and racialized peoples because we have seen this before in the places we work and think from. We are committed to supporting justice-oriented solidaristic movements across the Global South. Latin American thinkers and analysts continue to argue struggles in Palestine are relevant across Latin America (see <a href="https://nacla.org/weaving-solidarities-across-abya-yala-and-palestine">George Ygarza’s recent article in NACLA</a>), and these Southern struggles are at the fore of much of our work.
<br><br>
Finally, we acknowledge this is a difficult process, and we do not speak for the entirety of our membership. We welcome the productive and collegial discussions that have emerged, and we look forward to learning and working together.

{{< accordion title="Socialist and Critical Geography Specialty Group" >}}

The SCGSG stongly endorses the Geographers for Justice in Palestine petition and encourage all our members to consider supporting the campaign. Given the the violence that continues to be targeted upon the occupied territories, withdrawing financial and institutional support from an active genocide is a vital moral and political action. Geographers have long theorized, engaged with, and resisted the entanglements of colonialism, militarism, and global capitalism--struggles deeply linked to the occupation of Palestine. I urge our members to join the campaign and help organize for a BDS resolution within the AAG. Thank you to the Geographers for Justice in Palestine organizing group for keeping this critical issue at the center of our theorizing and organizing.
