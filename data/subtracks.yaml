- title: 'Contemporary Issues in the Levant'
  subtitle: 'Palestinian Futures'
  abstract: 'Amid the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the increased dispossession and violence in the West Bank since October 7, 2023, this sessionâ€™s theme, Palestinian Futures, invites conversation about Palestinian futures forged and envisioned that disrupt settler imaginaries of and quests for the future. Therefore, we aim to create a space for scholars to critically analyze the intersecting forces shaping the future of Palestine and the wider Levant, including those arising from settler colonialism, international displacement, and critical health and food insecurity to name a few.'
