As scholars and members of a professional association, we bear a unique responsibility to confront and address academic complicity and to expose and repudiate our discipline’s historical relation to empire, militarism and colonialism. It is in this spirit that we stand firm in our belief that ethical principles must guide our professional collaborations and academic endeavors to contribute to mold geographies of justice and liberation.
