## What is an academic boycott of Israel?
> Adapted from https://bdsmovement.net/academic-boycott#faqs. Note: The PACBI Guidelines for the International Academic Boycott of Israel are the authoritative guide for academic boycott of Israel. They can be viewed in full here.

{{< intro >}}

The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), which is the section of the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) tasked with overseeing the academic and cultural boycott aspects of BDS, has called since 2004 for a boycott of Israeli academic and cultural institutions.

{{</ intro >}}

This call is based on the fact that these institutions are deeply complicit in planning, implementing, justifying and/or whitewashing the Israeli system of oppression that has denied Palestinians their basic rights guaranteed by international law, or has hampered their exercise of these rights, including academic freedom and the right to education. The BDS movement opposes all forms of discrimination, including Islamophobia, antisemitism, and discrimination on the basis of nationality. There is a growing number of [anti-colonial Israelis](https://boycottisrael.info/) who support BDS, including the cultural boycott of Israel.

The academic boycott is a boycott of Israeli institutions, not individuals. The BDS movement rejects boycotting individuals on the basis of their identity and does not call for a boycott of individual Israeli academics simply because of their affiliation to a complicit university. However, this does not exclude Israeli academics who are appearing as representatives of a complicit institution (such as a president or spokesperson). It also does not exclude Israeli academics from “common sense” boycotts that are organised on the basis of opposition to someone’s support for or participation in violations of international law and human rights.
