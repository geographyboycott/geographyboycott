{{< accordion title="The Antipode Editorial Collective" >}}

The Antipode Editorial Collective is proud to endorse the Geographers for Justice in Palestine campaign for an academic boycott, by the American Association of Geographers (AAG), of Israeli academic institutions, and for disclosure and divestment of any AAG funds that go towards supporting the ongoing apartheid government of Israel. As a journal of radical geography, Antipode is fully committed to praxis. We can think of no better application of the theories our discipline has been producing in recent decades than to apply the extensive knowledge we have developed on settler colonialism, Orientalism, the geopolitics of the War on Terror, and genocide to actively intervene in the ongoing death and destruction of the Palestinian people and their homeland by supporting the call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) by Palestinian civil society.

In his inaugural 1969 editorial for Antipode, David Stea argued: "A society which measures man's (sic) worth in terms of volume of publications accumulated is no less sick than one which measures his worth in terms of dollars amassed." Fifty-six years later, we could not agree more. What is our knowledge for if not to transform the actually existing world, here and now? We convey much gratitude and solidarity to the Palestinian movement for self-determination, and allied groups such as the Geographers for Justice in Palestine, for awakening us, once more, from our dogmatic academic slumber. The time for concrete interventions is now. We stand firmly behind GJP and all geographers advancing the BDS movement.
