The Antipode Editorial Collective is proud to endorse the Geographers for Justice in Palestine campaign for an academic boycott, by the American Association of Geographers (AAG), of Israeli academic institutions, and for disclosure and divestment of any AAG funds that go towards supporting the ongoing apartheid government of Israel. As a journal of radical geography, Antipode is fully committed to praxis. We can think of no better application of the theories our discipline has been producing in recent decades than to apply the extensive knowledge we have developed on settler colonialism, Orientalism, the geopolitics of the War on Terror, and genocide to actively intervene in the ongoing death and destruction of the Palestinian people and their homeland by supporting the call for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) by Palestinian civil society.  
<br>
In his inaugural 1969 editorial for Antipode, David Stea argued: "A society which measures man's (sic) worth in terms of volume of publications accumulated is no less sick than one which measures his worth in terms of dollars amassed." Fifty-six years later, we could not agree more. What is our knowledge for if not to transform the actually existing world, here and now? We convey much gratitude and solidarity to the Palestinian movement for self-determination, and allied groups such as the Geographers for Justice in Palestine, for awakening us, once more, from our dogmatic academic slumber. The time for concrete interventions is now. We stand firmly behind GJP and all geographers advancing the BDS movement.

The Disability Specialty Group has endorsed the BDS pledge to boycott Israeli academic institutions. This commitment builds on our endorsement of the Geographers for Justice in Palestine AAG 2025 pre-conference. 

We bear witness to the bodily, emotional, and mental harm caused to Palestinians by Israel's illegal occupation. As geographers who write about, with, and through disability and debility, we cannot ignore the mass disabling events that the State of Israel and its allies have wrought upon Palestine (see Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha 2024 <a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2024/01/26/palestine-is-disabled/">here</a>). While we know the presence of disability is not antithetical to justice, its violent mass production in the name of settler colonialism must be stopped. With a tenuous ceasefire in place, Israel's apartheid regime still controls the Gaza strip and daily encroaches on ever more land and life in the West Bank. 

As critical disability scholars and disability justice activists have asserted, we must think internationally and multi-scalarly about disability and debility. There is no disability justice without justice for Palestine. Indeed, we must "consider how ableism acts on national bodies-occupied, colonized, Indigenous national bodies-as opposed to thinking about the body as a purely atomized individual entity" (Sheehi and Jaffee 2024, see <a href="https://rdsjournal.org/index.php/journal/article/view/1321/2790">here</a>). We stand in solidarity with Palestinians as an act of resistance against ableism and coloniality. 

We recognize that students and faculty around the world are facing professional and material repercussions for organizing for Palestinian liberation. As scholars, we strive to protect our students' right to such principled protests without persecution. Through this boycott pledge, we stand in solidarity with all those who continue to protest and boycott globally against apartheid and genocide.

The Energy & Environment Specialty Group (EESG) stands in solidarity for Palestinian self-determination, liberation and return. We encourage our specialty group members and other members of the AAG to support this petition to call a special meeting of the AAG about this issue. As energy geographers, we do applied scholarship. We are uniquely positioned to interrogate the intersections and entanglements of complex relations of energetic and political power. But alongside our analytical and pedagogical engagements, we must also work towards dismantling systems of oppression in support of emancipatory and transformational solutions to socio-ecological problems. The ongoing genocide against Palestinians and occupation of Palestine compels us to organize for liberation within our institutions and spheres of influence. A reckoning is long overdue. We must address the enduring epistemic injustices our discipline (geography) and subdiscipline (energy geographies) have enacted, sustained and exacerbated. We must address our complicity in genocidal and ecocidal atrocities globally. This is particularly true in Palestine. In closing, we implore you to join the GJP campaign to call a special AAG meeting. We invite you to participate in such abolitionist engagements within our discipline and group. Thank you for your consideration and advocacy for this cause. Free Palestine.

The SCGSG stongly endorses the Geographers for Justice in Palestine petition and encourage all our members to consider supporting the campaign. Given the the violence that continues to be targeted upon the occupied territories, withdrawing financial and institutional support from an active genocide is a vital moral and political action. Geographers have long theorized, engaged with, and resisted the entanglements of colonialism, militarism, and global capitalism--struggles deeply linked to the occupation of Palestine. I urge our members to join the campaign and help organize for a BDS resolution within the AAG. Thank you to the Geographers for Justice in Palestine organizing group for keeping this critical issue at the center of our theorizing and organizing.
