## The Heart of Arab-American activism & political action

Date: 3/27/2025
Time: 3:30 PM - 9:30 PM 

> Arab-Americans in Michigan, a crucial swing state, have recently made headlines as a key demographic in the 2024 election. Impacted by events in Palestine and Lebanon, this community launched a protest vote movement in the Democratic primary. This Dearborn-based field trip—the heart of Arab American cultural, economic, and political life—will include meetings with local organizers, political actors and allied worker coalitions to explore the formation and mobilization of this new political and cultural resistance movement, along with a walking tour of East Dearborn and the South End. This visit offers unique insight into nascent urban solidarity efforts among racialized and marginalized communities.
